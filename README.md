Divergence-free Tensor Densities in Two Dimensions
Abstract:

The study of divergence-free tensors has a rich history, with origins dating back to
the advent of general relativity and the Einstein tensor. Currently, research in this topic
is focused towards the (non-)existence of divergence-free tensors which are not variational.
Should any such tensor exist, it could immediately be used to create a modified version
of general relativity. Working in two dimensions for simplicity, we derive a formula which
explicitly characterizes all variational, second rank tensor densities dependent on a metric
and its derivatives to arbitrary order. Additionally, we create a partial classification of all
symmetric, second rank, divergence-free tensor densities dependent on a metric, a scalar
field, and derivatives of the scalar field to arbitrary order. Using this partial result, a
classification of all symmetric, second rank, divergence-free tensor densities which depend
on up to five derivatives of the metric is produced. In particular, such tensor densities with
highest derivative of order one, two, three, or five do not exist, while the densities of order
zero and order four are variational.
